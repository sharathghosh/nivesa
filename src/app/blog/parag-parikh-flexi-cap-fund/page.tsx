          The most striking aspect of Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund&apos;s performance is its remarkable stability over the long term. As of May 2025, the fund has delivered an impressive 10-year CAGR of approximately 17-18%, significantly outperforming both its benchmark and category average.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/30 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Performance Highlights</h4>
          <ul className="list-none pl-0">
            <li className="flex justify-between mb-2">

            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          This consistent outperformance is even more impressive when you consider that the fund has achieved this with lower volatility compared to many of its peers in the flexi cap category.
        </p>

        <h2>Investment Philosophy: The Secret Behind Stable Returns</h2>
        <p>
          The fund's remarkable stability can be attributed to its unique investment philosophy based on the principles of value investing. The fund management team follows a disciplined approach with these key tenets:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Value Investing Approach:</strong> The fund identifies businesses trading below their intrinsic value, focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and durable competitive advantages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Global Diversification:</strong> Up to 35% of the portfolio can be allocated to international equities, providing a natural hedge against rupee depreciation and access to global growth opportunities not available in the Indian market.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Long-term Perspective:</strong> The fund maintains a low portfolio turnover ratio (around 15-20%), indicating a patient, buy-and-hold strategy focused on long-term wealth creation rather than short-term gains.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Counter-cyclical Investing:</strong> The fund management team often takes contrarian positions, buying quality stocks during market corrections when they are available at attractive valuations.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Portfolio Composition</h2>
        <p>
          The fund maintains a well-diversified portfolio across market capitalizations and geographies:
        </p>

        <h3>Domestic-International Split</h3>
        <p>
          The fund typically maintains about 65-70% allocation to Indian equities and 25-30% to international stocks, with the remaining in cash and equivalents. This international exposure has been a significant contributor to its stable returns, particularly during periods when the Indian market has underperformed.
        </p>

        <h3>Market Capitalization Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Within its Indian equity portfolio, the fund maintains a balanced approach across market segments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Large Cap: ~60%</li>
          <li>Mid Cap: ~25%</li>
          <li>Small Cap: ~15%</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sector Allocation</h3>
        <p>
          The fund maintains a well-diversified sector exposure with historically higher allocations to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technology (both Indian IT services and global tech companies)</li>
          <li>Financial Services</li>
          <li>Consumer Discretionary</li>
          <li>Healthcare</li>
          <li>Industrials</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most compelling aspects of Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund is its risk-adjusted performance:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> Lower than category average, indicating less volatility</li>
          <li><strong>Sharpe Ratio:</strong> Higher than category average, suggesting better risk-adjusted returns</li>
          <li><strong>Beta:</strong> Typically less than 1, indicating lower market risk</li>
          <li><strong>Downside Capture Ratio:</strong> The fund has historically captured less of the market's downside movements</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These metrics demonstrate that the fund has not only delivered strong absolute returns but has done so with lower volatility than many of its peers.
        </p>

        <h2>Performance During Market Volatility</h2>
        <p>
          The true test of any mutual fund is how it performs during market downturns. Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund has shown remarkable resilience during market corrections:
        </p>

        <h3>2020 COVID-19 Market Crash</h3>
        <p>
          During the sharp market decline in March 2020, the fund demonstrated its defensive qualities by falling less than the broader market. The fund's international exposure, particularly to technology companies that benefited from the work-from-home trend, helped it recover quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>2022 Market Volatility</h3>
        <p>
          During the heightened volatility of 2022, when global markets struggled with inflation and interest rate concerns, the fund's balanced approach and quality focus helped it navigate the challenging environment more effectively than many peers.
        </p>

        <h2>Who Should Invest in This Fund?</h2>
        <p>
          Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund is particularly suitable for:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Long-term investors with an investment horizon of 5+ years</li>
          <li>Investors seeking global diversification through a domestic fund</li>
          <li>Those looking for a core equity holding in their portfolio</li>
          <li>Investors who appreciate a disciplined, value-oriented investment approach</li>
          <li>Those who prefer lower portfolio turnover and a buy-and-hold strategy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Taxation and Investment Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          As with all equity funds, investments in Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund are subject to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Short-term capital gains tax (15%) for holdings less than 12 months</li>
          <li>Long-term capital gains tax (10% above ₹1 lakh) for holdings more than 12 months</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The fund is suitable for both lump sum investments and Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). For most retail investors, a SIP approach can help average out market volatility and benefit from rupee cost averaging.
        </p>
